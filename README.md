# Python-Pig-latin
A simple Python program that converts English text into "Pig Latin".

**Capabilities:**
- Convert words that begin with both consonants and vowels to Pig Latin.
- Supports basic punctuation (.,!?).

**How to Use:**
- The message_to_words() function takes in a string and returns a list of words.
- The words_to_latin() function takes that string and converts it into a Pig Latin message.
- The [main.py](https://github.com/ciomperlik-zac/Python-Pig-latin/blob/main/main.py) file already has this set up, all you need to do is run it.

**Future Goals:**
- Add support for capitalization.
